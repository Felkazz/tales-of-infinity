========================


Introduction
------------
YMAMP is a WinAMP plugin that plays CYM and GYM log files produced by the
emulators Callus and Genecyst. A Pentium 200MHz or faster is recommended for
using YMAMP. However, it will run well on a machine as slow as a Pentium
133MHz, but you will not have enough CPU time to run most visualizations with
it. Anything slower than a Pentium 133MHz is not recommended, but there is
nothing stopping you from trying anyway :) Most CYM files will use about 90%
CPU time on a Pentium 133MHz. Most GYM files will use about 85% CPU time on
a Pentium 133MHz. It is less on faster machines and much less with sampling
rates lower than 48000. To use YMAMP, place in_ym.dll into your winamp\plugins
folder and restart WinAMP. You should then be able to open CYM and GYM files
from within WinAMP.

IMPORTANT: Make sure that you have no other plugins that play GYM or CYM
files in your winamp\plugins folder. YMAMP might not get used to play them
otherwise.


Warranty
--------
YMAMP comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. Use YMAMP at your own risk.


Known problems
--------------
Seeking sometimes ruins the sound.

Bitrate is not calculated. It always says zero.

YMAMP can't stream files across a network.

EQ does not work with 24000 and 48000 sampling rates.


Source notes
------------
Sources to YMAMP are available from YMAMP's web site.

Sources were written to be built with mingw32 or LCC-Win32, but it
shouldn't be hard to build it with another compiler system.

LCC-Win32 is the recommended free compiler system if you do not have access
to a commercial compiler system like Visual C++. You can get LCC-Win32 from
http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~lcc-win32/

To compile with mingw32 or cygwin, type "make -f makefile.gcc".

To compile with LCC-Win32, type "make -f makefile.lcc".

I do not recommend building YMAMP with mingw32 or cygwin on a Windows 9x
system.


Other notes
-----------
Feel free to send me comments about YMAMP and tell me about any bugs you find.
My E-Mail address is given below.

Do not ask me about problems using this plugin with versions of WinAMP prior
to 2.2x.

The default sampling rate is 44100 since that is the most compatable rate.
Use 48000 if you can since it sounds the best, or lower rates if you need
the extra CPU time. Use 44100 or 22050 if you want to use EQ.

There is no percussion or other sampled sound effects in CYM files. This is
not a bug. Sampled sounds in Callus are produced by a Z80 chip and the data
for it does not exist in CYM files. As far as GYM files are concerned, you
must use Megasis to get sampled audio within the GYM file. Hopefully other
Genesis emulators will add support for this.

Not all CYM or GYM files use stereo sound. Don't think anything is wrong
if it doesn't sound stereo.

Do not ask me for roms for Callus, Genecyst, or any other emulator or
where to find roms.

Do not ask me to send you any CYM or GYM files. Use Callus, Genecyst,
or Megasis to make them.

You may freely distribute YMAMP, but you are not allowed to sell it.


Credits
-------
YMAMP is written by Marp.

The YM2151,	YM2612, and SN76496	emualtion code come from M.A.M.E. version 0.36b12.
Some modifications were made to better suit YMAMP.

The input minisdk from Nullsoft was used as a skeleton for YMAMP.

YMAMP is compressed with UPX, the Ultimate Packer for eXecutables.

Thanks to Sevy. His program MSP gave me the idea to write this plugin.

Compression routines for GYM provided by zlib.

Thanks to Sardu for creating Callus and Genecyst. They are great emulators.

Thanks to Zophar's Domain and Emulation World for providing a new web site
for YMAMP and MSP.

History
-------
v2.0: Jan 02, 2000.
-Emulation code has been updated and now comes from M.A.M.E. v0.36b12
-Configuration is now saved in plugin.ini. You can safely delete the
 old configuration file.
-Updated web site URL to show YMAMP's new location. Webmasters please
 update your links. This will probably be the last time it moves.
-Redesigned the configuration dialog.
-New configuration options added:
 the ability to turn on/off individual channels
 the ability to adjust the emulated clock speed
-Redesigned "about" dialog.
-New info dialog for GYM files.
-Created a new GYM header format. Specifications for it are available
 in the source package.
-Added ability to compress/decompress GYM files.
-Fixed problem with sampled audio in GYM files. Thanks to Tatsuyuki Satoh
 for helping me fix this.

v1.3: Sep 03, 1999.
-DSP plugins now work with both GYM and CYM playback. E-Mail me at
 marp@technologist.com if you still have problems using DSP plugins with YMAMP.
-Fixed a display out-of-sync problem when using certain DSP plugins.
-Default sampling rate is now 44100 for compatability reasons. Use 48000 if
 you can.
-Binary distribution is now compiled with gcc 2.9.5. This gives about a 5% to
 10% speed increase on a Pentium 133MHz over previous versions of YMAMP.
-Improved makefile for gcc.
-Merged in2.h and out.h into in_ym.h.

v1.2: Jul 30, 1999.
-DSP plugins now work with GYM playback.
-Added a configuration dialog. It is now possible to configure the sampling
 rate and thread priority.
-YMAMP no longer assumes memory allocated successfully.
-Improved visualization synchronization.
-Cleaned up a large portion of the sources.
-Reformatted sources to be more compact and readable.
-Added some comments to in_ym.c for people interested in the source.
-Eliminated almost all of the dozens of warnings that Visual C++ would give.
-Added a makefile for building with LCC-Win32.
-Seeking is now back to 1/60 sec precision since 1/1000 sec precision didn't
 improve anything.

v1.1: Released Jul 04, 1999.
-Seeking is now 1/1000 second precise.
-Playback loops adjusted to be more logical. Reduces CPU consumption by about
 2-3% on a Pentium 133MHz.
-Added build date and time to the "about" dialog.
-Updated web site URL to show YMAMP's new location.

v1.0: Released Jun 27, 1999.
-Initial release.

Enjoy.
