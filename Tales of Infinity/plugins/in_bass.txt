Installation
============

If at installation you chose not to rename "in_mod.dll" you have to
remove/rename the default module player "in_mod.dll" manually 
if you experience any problems like modules appearing twice after adding 
a whole directory to the playlist.


What's the point?
=================
BASS MPP is an XM/IT/MOD/S3M player for Windows 9x/NT. It's got the
best (most accurate to FT2) XM reproduction to be heard from any player.
All features/effects (including several FT2 quirks) are 100% supported.
The IT reproduction is also practically balls-on, with full support for
all effects/NNA/DCA/filters etc...

Requirements
============
BASS MPP requires DirectX 3 or above, so it not only works with Windows
95/98/2000, but also Windows NT 4.0 (with service pack 4). BASS does
not require that a soundcard with DirectSound/DirectSound3D hardware
accelerated drivers is installed, but it does improve performance if
there is one. BASS also takes advantage of MMX acceleration, which
improves the performance of the MOD music playback.
