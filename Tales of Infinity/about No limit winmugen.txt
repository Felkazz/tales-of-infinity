about unoficial no-limit Winmugen patch
by : rouhei
-----------------------------

no-limit patch is limit cancel patch for Winmugen20414.
　1. hide *f-4x6 font (cancel force debug font）
　2、cancel character limit ( 2 > 65535 )
　3、cancel mode limit

I did successful cancel character limit of WINMUGEN.
but...
if I do release to public, does people get angry ? 

no limit patch have not permission of elecbyte.
yes. this unoficial patch conflict with a elecbyte license.

but, 2 years passed since new mugen was not released.
and  1 years passed since elecbyte website was close & no announcement.  

I think that..... 
Elecbyte maybe does not revive some time.
and new mugen maybe will not be released.

if official is closed forever, if official have never intention 
of release Winmugen , we can not but remake & patching.
I think so. winmugen of way is only it.
Somebody surely fix limit in future , even if I do not fix now.
is it wrong ? 

no limit Winmugen is so easy .
people of non DOS environment, a lot of new user , new peoples & 
beginners can enjoy non limit winmugen
I want more a lot of people to enjoy wonderfull mugen.
I hope it only.
it only..





please dont angry.
please enjoy it... :)

about stop release
-----------------------

I love fighting games & mugen , and I hope revival of elecbyte.
if official warn hack version, I stop release this patch.  

if elecbyte revive or elecbyte is alive  , 
anyways , I stop release this patch to public. 

if official is available , hack version is needless.
